This is mainly due to 5ireChain’s business idea that is created upon a for-benefit paradigm, known as the proof-of-benefit model. The proof-of-benefit model allows sustainable practices that are beneficial for the environment. The impact of this model is that business entities not only focus on profit making but they also take sustainability into consideration.‍"
